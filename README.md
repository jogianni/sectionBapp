# sectionBapp

Welcome to SectionB App! An app designed for analyzing high interaction medium sized group chats. Born of an MBA WhatsApp chat I sought to build an app that would provide fun metrics for group chats where the participants had a lot of interaction outside of the chat itself. 

The tool has several steps:
  1. Export the data from Whatsapp, usually found if you go to the groupchat and scroll to the bottom it says 'export chat'
  2. load the data into your google drive
  3. run the code
  4. grab the export and create visualizations in Tableau or your preferred visualization 

## Notes
### Requirements
1. The tool requires you to be able to export your whatsapp data, this is easy on iPhone but can be quite difficult on other phones such as huawei products
2. Visualizations were built in Tableau which requires a license, something free available to students
